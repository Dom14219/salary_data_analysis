# Salary Data Analysis Dashboard

## Data Source

The original dataset was sourced from [Kaggle: Salary Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data).
-Salary_Data.csv is the original file
-Salary_Data_copy.csv is the cleaned version I used for this project

This project analyzes salary data across various factors like education, job title, years of experience, age, and gender. The Excel dashboard features multiple PivotTables and charts that highlight trends, outliers, and top earners.

## Key Insights

- PhD holders earn significantly more than those with a bachelor's degree.
- There's a measurable gender pay gap in favor of men.
- The CEO role has the highest average salary in the dataset.
- Age and years of experience reveal patterns in earning potential.

## Data Cleaning

The original CSV dataset was cleaned by:
- Removing blank rows and cells.
- Standardizing education level entries to ensure consistency (e.g., merging variations of "Bachelor's" and "Master's").
- Ensuring no missing or incomplete rows before analysis.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and dashboard creation.
- PivotTables and PivotCharts for dynamic summaries and visuals.
